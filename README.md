# Neural Net

I wrote a Densely Connected Neural Network in Python without using any machine learning libraries. It can be used for regression and classification tasks. The provided files regression.py and iris_classification.py demonstrate that. The implemented activation functions are sigmoid and relu. The net contains one hidden layer, the number of neurons in it can be adjusted.
